# Spotify-Features-DSA
This project is related to programming features for songs available on Spotify by using different data structures. 

# Overview
The dataset consists of two files named Book1 and Book2 which contain information about songs available on Spotify. Book1 is used in the implementation of the WordSearch feature in which the user is presented with a wordsearch grid and has to search the names of three artists in the grid. Array ADT is used to create the WordSearch grid and Tries data structure is used to verify that the user found the artist. Book 2 is used for other features such as searching the song by name and displaying the total number of songs for each artist with the use of AVL Trees. In addition, max and min Heap are used to display the longest, shortest, most popular and least popular songs respectively. Lastly, a Hash Table is created to group songs based on genres and display the songs of each genre.
